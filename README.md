# Hangman
The game of hangman consists of guessing the letters in a word with limited number of tries. If the person fails to guess a correct letter the number of tries reduce and eventually the person hangs himself. On the contrary, if he guesses a letter correct, the number of tries remain as they are and eventually the person about to hang himself is saved.
